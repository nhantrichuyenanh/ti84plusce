In high school, I lost the calculator I had been using since junior high. Instead of buying a new one, my dad gave his TI-84 Plus CE calculator to me. Initially, I found it awkward and foreign to use it, but eventually, I couldn't imagine doing schoolwork without it. In case I ever need to reset my calculator and redownload the necessary programs, this repository will be useful.

| 1 | [BASECONV](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/BASECONVERSION.8xp) | ![](/demo/BASECONV.png) | Useful for ComSci I guess `¯\_(ツ)_/¯` |
| 2 | [CIRCLE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/CIRCLE.8xp) | ![](/demo/CIRCLE.png) | Not just another degrees to radians converter. |
| 3 | [EQSOLVER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/EQUATIONSOLVER.8xp) | ![](/demo/EQSOLVER.png) | $$5^{x^2 - 4x} = \frac{1}{25^{(x-2)}}$$ |
| 4 | [FACTOR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/FACTOR.8xp) | ![](/demo/FACTOR.png) | $$420 = 2^{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$$ |
| 5 | [LINEFIND](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/LINEFIND.8xp) | ![](/demo/LINEFIND.png) | Quickly get the linear equation instead of manually calculating $y = ax + b$. |
| 6 | [LOGARITHM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/LOGARITHM.8xp) | ![](/demo/LOGARITHM.png) | $\log_{2}(8)$ |
| 7 | [POLYFACT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/POLYFACTOR.8xp) | ![](/demo/POLYFACT.png) | $$x^3 - x = x(x + 1)(x - 1)$$ |
| 8 | [TRIGONOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/TRIGONOMETRIC.8xp) | ![](/demo/TRIGONOM.png) | Degree also works. |
