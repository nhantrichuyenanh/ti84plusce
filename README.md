In high school, I lost the calculator I had been using since junior high. Instead of buying a new one, my dad gave me his TI-84 Plus CE calculator. Initially, I found it awkward and foreign to use, but eventually, I couldn't imagine doing schoolwork without it. I plan to use it well into college, so I need to keep track of programs I use and don't use. In case I ever need to reset my calculator and reinstall the necessary programs, this repository will be useful.

| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | [CIRCLE](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/CIRCLE.8xp) | ![](/demo/CIRCLE.png) | Removed `R<>D Cnv` from original program because it's buggy and refactored code! I plan to add `Formulae`, though I can't promise anything. |
| 2 | [CLEARRAM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/CLEARRAM.8xp) | ![](/demo/CLEARRAM.png) | Doesn't clear all functions in the Y= editor, because there is no command for it `:(` |
| 3 | [DISMID](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/DISTANCEMIDPOINT.8xp) | ![](/demo/DISMID.png) | • Quickly calculate distance and midpoint of two points. <br> • Sorry if the output looks weird compared to other programs, because I replaced `Disp(` from the original program with `Output(` so that the results are displayed within the same line instead of being pushed down in a new line. |
| 4 | [EQSOLVER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/EQUATIONSOLVER.8xp) | ![](/demo/EQSOLVER.png) | $$5^{x^2 - 4x} = \frac{1}{25^{(x-2)}}$$ <br> • This program can only return real roots because it uses `solve(`. It can't return complex solutions. <br> • For some equations, `ERROR: NO SIGN CHANGE` is completely normal. Just press ENTER or 1 and see the results. <br> • Because this program inputs statement as string, you can't write it in MATHPRINT. <br> • Remember to clear  Y1, Y2, and Y3 in the Y= editor after using the program. |
| 5 | [FACTOR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/FACTOR.8xp) | ![](/demo/FACTOR.png) | $$420 = 2^{2} \cdot 3 \cdot 5 \cdot 7$$ <br> • Unlike other programs displaying the result as a list or each factor in a new line, this one displays it as a factorization. Unfortunately, I can't get it to display factor with exponent, so if the result is long, the program might return `ERROR: DOMAIN`. <br> • I also refactored the code. |
| 6 | [LOG](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/LOGARITHM.8xp) | ![](/demo/LOG.png) | $$\log_{2}(8) = 3$$ <br> I added this program to the list is because I don't always remember the appropiate parameters for log( to use it in regular calculations or `EQSOLVER` program, and I can't be bothered to [ALPHA][F2][5] to use logBASE( every time. |
| 7 | [POLYFACT](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/POLYNOMIALFACTORING.8xp) | ![](/demo/POLYFACT.png) | $$x^3 - x = x(x + 1)(x - 1)$$ <br> As of writing this, I don't know how to fix the issue of not being able to exit out. A band-aid solution is to just reboot the calculator. |
| 8 | [POLYINTP](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/POLYNOMINALINTERPOLATION.8xp) | ![](/demo/POLYINTP.png) |$$y=x^2-2x-1$$ <br> Once graph is drawn, you can press CLEAR. <br> • Linear: 2 <br> • Quadratic: 3 (weird because for $-x^2+4x$ I have to input 4 points...) <br> • Cubic: 4 <br> • Quartic: 5 |
| 9 | [TRIGONOM](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nhantrichuyenanh/ti84plusce/main/pgrm/TRIGONOMETRIC.8xp) | ![](/demo/TRIGONOM.png) | Degree also works. |
