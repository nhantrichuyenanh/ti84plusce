In high school, I lost the calculator I had been using since junior high. Instead of buying a new one, my dad gave his TI-84 Plus CE calculator to me. Initially, I found it awkward and foreign to use it, but eventually, I couldn't imagine doing schoolwork without it. In case I ever need to reset my calculator and redownload the necessary programs, this repository will be useful.
